RFID Solution

where it will be installed ? to which object ?
is it once to read or bulk to read ?


UHF ( Ultra High Frequency ) = Range up to 12m

1-Active RFID (More expensive but longer range) (required internal battery)
	- Transponders (Only wake up when they receive radio signal)
2-Passive RFID (Less Expensive and shorter range)
	- Salik is Passive tag powered by the transceiver in the toll gate without internal battery

Passive solution is better 

- RFID as read-only with generated serial number to be a master key in database to store data.
- RFID Field programmable tags to be written one time only. ( Preffered to be a hashed sha-256 encrypted value stored in database as master key )

Reader Type:
- Active Reader Passive Tag (ARPT): Active Reader to transmits interrogator signals and receive authentication from Passive Tag.

Demo Requirements:

- Database Type & Sample table

----------

work flow

RFID Reader will get RFID Tag serial by scanning
reader will send the serial through attached device to the (API with get request)
API will reply with required data from database to render it to the user (Web or mobile application)
